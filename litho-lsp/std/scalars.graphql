"""
The Int scalar type represents a signed 32-bit numeric non-fractional value.
Response formats that support a 32-bit integer or a number type should use that
type to represent this scalar.

scalar Int

"""
The Float scalar type represents signed double-precision finite values as
specified by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).
Response formats that support an appropriate double-precision number type should
use that type to represent this scalar.
"""
scalar Float

"""
The String scalar type represents textual data, represented as a sequence of
Unicode code points. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent
free-form human-readable text. How the String is encoded internally (for example
UTF-8) is left to the service implementation. All response serialization formats
must support a string representation (for example, JSON Unicode strings), and
that representation must be used to serialize this type.
"""
scalar String

"""
The Boolean scalar type represents `true` or `false`. Response formats should
use a built-in boolean type if supported; otherwise, they should use their
representation of the integers `1` and `0`.
"""
enum Boolean {
    false
    true
}

"""
The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an
object or as the key for a cache. The ID type is serialized in the same way as a
`String`; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. While it is often
numeric, it should always serialize as a `String`.
